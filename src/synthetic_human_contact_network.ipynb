{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Synthetic Human Contact Network\n","\n","This is the first step in creating the Urban Transportation Disease Spread Simulator. Synthetic Human Contact Network is the backbone of the simulator (TranEpiSim). I utilized the methodology proposed by [**Burger et al. (2017)**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3145574.3145593?casa_token=z6J9RUlCP3UAAAAA:7Ie0L7W9_bmIsaR9JHfutQgyYJ9aIj0dC2ZnuGhQaF4x46QOczVq1FwfH7dsDloAcwDCH26pjOM) to create a large-scale human contact network adapted for a disease system. The code for constructing the network was obtained from **Talha Oz's** Jupyter notebook repository, which provides detailed instructions and can be accessed [**here**](https://nbviewer.org/gist/oztalha/a1c167f3879c5b95f721acef791c8111/Population%20Synthesis%20for%20ABM.ipynb). It has wondeful instructions and you can start from there if you want to develop a network for your own application. I will provide concise instructions and details for this notebook unless changes are made to the network.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0NtMu1reQvO1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.
