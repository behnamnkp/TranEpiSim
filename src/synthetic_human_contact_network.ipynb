The code for constructing the network was obtained from Talha Oz's Jupyter notebook repository, which provides detailed instructions and can be accessed [here](https://nbviewer.org/gist/oztalha/a1c167f3879c5b95f721acef791c8111/Population%20Synthesis%20for%20ABM.ipynb). It has wondeful instructions and you can start from there if you want to develop a network for your own application. I will provide concise instructions and details for this notebook unless changes are made to the network.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0NtMu1reQvO1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.
